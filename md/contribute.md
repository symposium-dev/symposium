# How to contribute

Symposium is an open-source project in active development. We're iterating heavily and welcome collaborators who want to shape where this goes.

## Come chat with us

The best way to get involved is to join us on [Zulip](https://symposium-dev.zulipchat.com/). We use it for design discussions, coordination, and general conversation about AI-assisted development.

Drop in, say hello, and tell us what you're interested in working on.

## The codebase

The code lives at [github.com/symposium-dev/symposium](https://github.com/symposium-dev/symposium). 

We maintain a [code of conduct](https://github.com/symposium-dev/symposium/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and operate as an independent community exploring what AI has to offer for software development.

## Expectations

Given the exploratory nature of Symposium, expect frequent changes. APIs are unstable, and we're still figuring out the right abstractions. This is a good time to contribute if you want to influence the direction — but be prepared for things to shift as we learn.
