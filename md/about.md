# What we want to achieve

You fire up your agent of choice through Symposium. It has a more collaborative style, remembers the way you like to work. It knows about your dependencies and incorporates advice supplied by the crate authors on how best to use them. You can install extensions that transform the agent — new skills, new MCP servers, or more advanced capabilities like custom GUI interfaces and new ways of working.

## AI the Rust Way

Symposium brings Rust's design philosophy to AI-assisted development.

<h3>Leverage the wisdom of <s>the crowd</s> crates.io</h3>

Rust embraces a small stdlib and a rich crate ecosystem. Symposium brings that philosophy to AI: your dependencies can teach your agent how to use them. Add a crate, and your agent learns its idioms, patterns, and best practices.

Beyond crate knowledge, we want to make it easy to publish agent extensions that others can try out and adopt just by adding a line to their configuration — the same way you'd add a dependency to `Cargo.toml`.

<h3>Stability without stagnation</h3>

Rust evolves quickly and agents' training data goes stale. Symposium helps your agent take advantage of the latest Rust features and learn how to use new or private crates — things not found in its training data.

We provide guides and context that keep models up-to-date, helping them write idiomatic Rust rather than JavaScript-in-disguise.

<h3>Open, portable, and vendor neutral</h3>

Open source tools that everyone can improve. Build extensions once, use them with any ACP-compatible agent. No vendor lock-in.
