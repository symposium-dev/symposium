# Built-in Extensions

Symposium ships with three built-in extensions that enhance your agent's capabilities for Rust development.

- **[Sparkle](./sparkle.md)** - AI collaboration framework that learns your working patterns
- **[Ferris](./ferris.md)** - Rust crate source inspection
- **[Cargo](./cargo.md)** - Compressed cargo command output

See [Using Symposium](./symposium.md) for how to enable, disable, and reorder extensions.
