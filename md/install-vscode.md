# VSCode and VSCode-based editors

Install the Symposium extension from:

- [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=symposium.symposium)
- [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/symposium/symposium)

## Getting started

Once installed, you'll see the Symposium icon in the Activity Bar on the left side of your editor:

<img src="./artwork/ferris-in-a-robe-thick.svg" alt="Symposium icon" width="48"/>

Click the icon to open the Symposium panel. From there you can select your agent and start a chat session.
