<!--
    STYLE GUIDELINES:
    
    - Avoid promotional language: no "rich", "powerful", "easy", etc.
    - No "Benefits" sections - they're promotional by nature
    - No duplicate table of contents at chapter ends
    - Be factual and technical, not persuasive
    - Describe what the system does, not why it's good
