---

Symposium is a set of components that make AI agents work better. These components are compatible with any ACP-based editing system, including Zed, VSCode (with this extension), and IntelliJ and NeoVim (coming soon).

## Features

### Rust Crate Sources Tool

Query the source code of any Rust crate directly. When the agent needs to understand how a crate works, it can examine the actual implementation rather than relying on potentially outdated documentation.

### Rich Collaboration (coming soon)

Interactive patterns for human-AI partnership beyond simple text exchanges, including Sparkle collaborative identity, walkthroughs, and taskspaces.

### Ecosystem-Powered Knowledge (coming soon)

Crate authors will be able to provide specialized AI tooling through Cargo.toml metadata, bringing domain knowledge directly to the agent.

## Status

⚠️ **Pre-alpha software** - expect frequent changes. We welcome users and contributors, but this is exploratory work.
