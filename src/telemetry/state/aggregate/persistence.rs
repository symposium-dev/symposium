//! Private wire conversion for aggregate telemetry state.
//!
//! Runtime trackers deliberately do not implement Serde: they contain keyed
//! session identifiers, and a general serializer would make accidental
//! disclosure easy. This module is the only bridge between those runtime
//! values and `telemetry-state.toml`.
//!
//! Borrowed store wire types declare scalar metadata before their entry
//! arrays. TOML renders those arrays as tables and cannot encode a later
//! scalar, reporting `ValueAfterTable` instead.
//!
//! Family validators reject duplicate row identifiers within one store. The
//! root aggregate-state validator owns cross-family identifier uniqueness and
//! agreement between every store day and the identity high-water day.
