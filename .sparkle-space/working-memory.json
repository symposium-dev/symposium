  "focus": "Documenting Symposium 2.0 architecture based on SACP proxy framework",
  "current_state": "Completed initial implementation overview documentation",
  "key_understanding": {
    "architecture": "Symposium is a meta-proxy that internally uses a SACP conductor in proxy mode to orchestrate dynamic component chains",
    "component_pattern": "Some features use component/adapter pairs - components enrich capabilities, adapters shim for missing primitives",
    "capability_driven": "Conductor examines both upstream (editor) and downstream (agent) capabilities during init to build the right proxy chain",
    "sacp_framework": "Using sacp crates (1.0-alpha.2) published on crates.io - sacp, sacp-proxy, sacp-conductor",
    "meta_capabilities": "Capabilities stored in _meta.symposium using MetaCapabilityExt trait pattern from sacp crate"
  },
  "recent_achievements": [
    "Updated md/design/implementation-overview.md with SACP-based architecture explanation",
    "Added style guidelines to md/SUMMARY.md (no promotional language, factual technical writing)",
    "Clarified component/adapter pattern - not all features need adapters",
    "Removed promotional sections (Benefits, duplicate ToCs)"
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "Create initialization-sequence.md chapter covering capability negotiation protocol",
    "Update components.md to align with new understanding",
    "Review and update ide_operations.md for consistency",
    "Consider adding capability reference documentation"
  ],
  "collaboration_state": "Good flow - Niko providing architectural vision, I'm documenting and asking clarifying questions about meta structure before diving into specifics"
